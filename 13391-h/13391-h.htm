    <p><i>The Vicar's Daughter</i> (<i>suddenly recognising the New
    Curate, who is blinking unsuspectingly in the lantern
    rays</i>). Oh, Mr. TOOTLER, you've just come in time to help
    us! The man with the lantern says he only manages the slides,
    and can't do the talking part. And I've asked lots of people,
    and no one will volunteer. <i>Would</i> you mind just
    explaining the pictures to the children? It's only a little
    Nursery tale&mdash;<i>Valentine and Orson</i>&mdash;I chose
    that, because it's less hackneyed, and has such an excellent
    <i>moral</i>, you know. I'm sure you'll do it so
    <i>beautifully</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Tootler</i> (<i>a shy man</i>). I&mdash;I'd do it
    with pleasure, I'm sure&mdash;only I really don't know anything
    about <i>Valentine and Orson</i>!</p>

    <p><i>The V's D.</i> Oh, what <i>does</i> that matter? I can
    tell you the outline in two minutes. (<i>She tells him.</i>)
    But it's got to last an hour, so you must spin it out as much
    as ever you can.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Tootler</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Ought I to neglect
    such a golden opportunity of winning these young hearts? No.
    (<i>Aloud.</i>) I will&mdash;er&mdash;do my best, and perhaps I
    had better begin at once, as they seem to be
    getting&mdash;er&mdash;rather unruly at the further end of the
    room. (<i>He clears his throat.</i>) Children, you must be very
    quiet and attentive, and then we shall be able, as we purpose
    this evening, to show you some scenes illustrative of
    the&mdash;er&mdash;beautiful old story of <i>Valentine and
    Orson</i>, which I doubt not is familiar to you all. (<i>Rustic
    applause, conveyed by stamping and shrill cheers, after which a
    picture is thrown on the screen representing a Village
    Festival.</i>) Here, children, we have a view
    of&mdash;er&mdash;(<i>with sudden
    inspiration</i>)&mdash;Valentine's Native Village. It
    is&mdash;er&mdash;his birthday, and Valentine, being a young
    man who is universally beloved on account of his amiability and
    good conduct&mdash;(<i>To the Vicar's D.</i> "Is that correct?"
    <i>The V.'s D.</i> "Quite, <i>quite</i> correct!")&mdash;good
    conduct, the villagers are celebrating
    the&mdash;er&mdash;auspicious event by general rejoicings. How
    true it is that if we are only <i>good</i>, we may, young as we
    are, count upon gaining the affection and esteem of all around
    us! (<i>A Youthful Rustic, with a tendency to heckle.</i> "Ef
    'ee plaze, Zur, which on 'em be Valentoine?") Valentine, we may
    be very sure, would not be absent on such an occasion,
    although, owing to the crowd, we cannot distinguish him. But,
    wherever he is, however he may be occupied, he little thinks
    that, before long, he will have to encounter the terrible
    Orson, the Wild Man of the Woods! Ah, dear children, we all
    have our Wild Man of the Woods to fight. With <i>some</i> of us
    it is&mdash;(<i>He improves the occasion.</i>) Our next picture
    represents&mdash;(<i>To Assistant.</i>) Sure this comes next?
    Oh, they're all numbered, are they? Very well&mdash;represents
    a forest&mdash;er&mdash;the home of Orson. If we were permitted
    to peep behind one of those trunks, we should doubtless see
    Orson himself, crouching in readiness to spring upon the
    unsuspecting Valentine. So, often when we&mdash;&amp;c.,
    &amp;c. The next scene we shall show you represents
    the&mdash;er&mdash;burning of Valentine's ship. Valentine has
    gone on a voyage, with the object of&mdash;er&mdash;finding
    Orson. If the boat in the picture was only larger, we could no
    doubt identify Valentine, sitting there undismayed, calmly
    confident that, notwithstanding this&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunate
    interruption, he will be guided, sooner or later, to
    his&mdash;er&mdash;goal. Yes, dear children, if we only have
    patience, if we only have faith, &amp;c., &amp;c. Here we
    see&mdash;(<i>an enormous Bison is suddenly depicted on the
    screen</i>) eh? oh, yes&mdash;here we have a specimen
    of&mdash;er&mdash;Orson's <i>pursuits</i>. He chases the bison.
    Some of you may not know what a bison is. It is a kind of hairy
    cow, and&mdash;(<i>He describes the habits of these creatures
    as fully as he is able.</i> <i>The Youthful Rustic</i>. "Theer
    baint nawone a-erntin' of 'un, Zur.") What? Oh, but there
    <i>is</i>. Orson is pursuing him, only&mdash;er&mdash;the
    bison, being a very fleet animal, has outrun his pursuer for
    the moment. Sometimes we flatter ourselves that we have outrun
    <i>our</i> pursuer&mdash;but, depend upon it, &amp;c., &amp;c.
    But now let us see what Valentine is
    about&mdash;(<i>Discovering, not without surprise, that the
    next picture is a Scene in the Arctic Regions.</i>) Well, you
    see, he has succeeded in reaching the coast, and here he
    is&mdash;in a sledge drawn by a reindeer, with nothing to guide
    him but the Aurora Borealis, hastening towards the spot where
    he has been told he will find Orson. He doesn't despair,
    doesn't lose heart&mdash;he is sure that, if he only keeps on,
    if he&mdash;er&mdash;only continues, only
    perseveres&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i> What drivel I <i>am</i>
    talking! <i>To Assistant</i>. I say, are there many <i>more</i>
    of this sort? because we don't seem to be getting
    on!)&mdash;Well, now we come to&mdash;(<i>a Moonlight Scene,
    with a Cottage in Winter, appears</i>)&mdash;to
    the&mdash;ah&mdash;home of Valentine's <i>mother</i>. You will
    observe a light in the casement. By that light the good old
    woman is sitting, longing and praying for the return of her
    gallant boy. Ah, dear children, what a thing a good old mother
    is! (<i>To the Vicar's Daughter</i>. "I really can <i>not</i>
    keep on like this much longer. I'm positively certain these
    slides are out of order!") <i>The V.'s D.</i> "Oh no; I'm sure
    it's <i>all</i> right. Do <i>please</i> go on. They're
    <i>so</i> interested!" <i>The Young Heckler</i>. "'Ow bout
    Valentoine, Zur?&mdash;wheer be 'ee?" Ah, where is Valentine,
    indeed? (<i>To Ass.</i>) Next slide&mdash;quick! (<i>Recognises
    with dismay a View of the Grand Canal.</i>) No&mdash;but, I
    say&mdash;<i>really</i> I <i>can't</i>&mdash;Here we have
    Valentine at Venice. He has reached that beautiful
    city,&mdash;well called the Queen of the Adriatic,&mdash;at
    last! He contemplates it from his gondola, and yet he has no
    heart just now to take in all the beauty of the scene. He feels
    that he is still no nearer to finding Orson than before.
    (<i>The Young Heckler</i>. "Naw moor be we, Zur. We ain't zeed
    <i>nayther</i> on 'em zo fur!" <i>Tumult, and a general demand
    for the instant production of Orson or Valentine.</i>) Now,
    children, children! this is very irregular. You must allow me
    to tell this story my own way. You will see them both in good
    time, if you only keep still! (<i>To Ass.</i>) I can't stand
    this any more. Valentine and Orson must be underneath the rest.
    Find them, and shove them in quick. Never mind the numbering!
    (<i>The screen remains blank while the Assistant fumbles.</i>)
    Well, have you <i>got</i> them?</p>

    <p><i>The Assistant</i>. No, Sir; I'm rather afraid they ain't
    <i>here</i>. Fact is, they've sent me out with the wrong set o'
    slides. This ain't <i>Valentine and Orson&mdash;it's a
    miscellaneous lot, Sir!</i></p>

    <p>A LAST WORD ON THE WHAT-YOU-MAY-CAL-DERON PICTURE.&mdash;It
    isn't often that one of "the inferior clergy," represented by a
    Clarke in orders, is pitted against an "Abbott," as recently
    happened in the discussion about Mr. CALDERON's picture of
    "<i>St. Elizabeth's Heroic Act of Renunciation</i>." In this
    instance the Clarke got the better of the Abbott, and the
    others, including Professor HUXLEY, who is always ready to rush
    in and invite somebody to tread on the tail of his coat, were
    nowhere. The <i>Times</i> issues its <i>fiat</i>, concluding
    the arguments on both sides&mdash;"The <i>Times</i> has spoken,
    <i>causa finita est</i>"&mdash;and the picture will remain one
    of the chief attractions in the Royal Academy Exhibition until
    such time as it ascends to the undisturbed Oilysium of The
    Happily Immortals. In the meantime, being on the line, Mr.
    CALDERON will be perfectly satisfied if his picture be
    generally recognised as "<i>St. Elisabeth of
    Well-Hung-ary</i>."</p>

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Billsbury, Thursday, May 22</i>.&mdash;Came down here
    yesterday, to stay for a fortnight on end. Four meetings have
    been arranged in different wards, and a good deal of time is to
    be devoted to canvassing. Pleasant prospect! Begin to think
    that, on the whole, it was easier work to wear an occasional
    wig in the Law Courts, or to sit in Chambers, planning
    imaginary Law-books.</p>

    <p>On Tuesday I lunched with the BELLAMYS, to say good-bye.
    Mrs. BELLAMY made herself very agreeable. Somebody, so she
    said, had told her that my chances at Billsbury were excellent,
    and she declared she had always admired young men who devoted
    themselves with a single-hearted purpose to the service of
    their country. So different from the crowd "Of shallow-pates,
    who scorn laborious days. And shun the rugged paths that lead
    to praise." This is a familiar quotation from the works of
    "your grandfather, the poet." Mrs. BELLAMY quotes him on all
    possible occasions. A long time ago she gave me a beautifully
    bound copy of his book, "<i>Per Ardua</i>, by HENRY GATTLETON,
    M.A." I've got a notion she has a whole room-full of the unsold
    copies, somewhere at the top of the house.</p>

    <p>After luncheon had a long talk with MARY, who really looked
    prettier than I've ever seen her. She said, "Now that you have
    got into what Mamma calls 'the vortex of politics,' I suppose
    you'll despise all our simple little amusements, and begin to
    forget everybody except the Billsbury voters." I asked her how
    she could say such a thing, told her I never could forget the
    happy hours I'd spent with her at Exhibitions and dances, and
    so forth, and assured her I loathed the Billsbury voters
    (which, by the way, I really think I do). I was just beginning
    to screw myself up to the pitch of asking her <i>the</i>
    question, in fact, I had taken her hand, and was actually
    stuttering out something which made her look down at her feet
    (she's got the smallest and prettiest foot I ever saw), when
    the footman opened the door and announced POMFRET. Of course
    POMFRET must have seen something was up. He's a beast, but not
    a fool. But he chattered away volubly, just as if he were the
    most delightful and welcome person in the world. I got so angry
    after ten minutes of it, and my toes and fingers began to have
    such an almost irresistible longing to be at him, that I
    thought it best to go. But MARY gave me a look as I went away
    which simply went right through me, the kindest and most
    beautiful look any two eyes ever gave to an unhappy man. I shut
    my eyes constantly and bring the whole scene back, and in
    imagination I throw POMFRET out of the window, and carry MARY
    in triumph to the nearest church, while her mother quotes the
    late Mr. GATTLETON's poetry over us in blessing. And then I
    open them again and find myself in this hole.</p>

    <p>Dinner with the CHORKLES on Saturday.</p>

    <p><i>May 23</i>.&mdash;Started canvassing yesterday and
    continued to-day under the charge of Mr. DIKES, one of the Town
    Councillors. "Old DICKY DIKES," the people here always call
    him. He's supposed to be one of the most knowing cards in the
    whole county. A man of about sixty-four, with light brown hair,
    rather curly, a wig, say his detractors, but I can't make my
    mind up about it yet, as I haven't been able to study him
    closely with his hat off. His head is large, face a cross
    between J.L. TOOLE's and DIZZY's without the goatee. Always
    wears a frock-coat of best broadcloth, and an immense top-hat.
    Has one curiously protruding tooth which fascinates me, and
    makes my attention wander when he's telling me his anecdotes. I
    keep wondering how it ever got into that strange
    position&mdash;a sort of dental rocking-stone, weird, solitary,
    inexplicable. Everybody knows him, as he represents the St.
    Mark's Ward (which we are canvassing) in the Council. The
    flourish with which he always introduces me is wonderful. I
    might be an Emperor honouring the place with a visit. But the
    people take it all as a matter of course, and seem pleased to
    see us. They don't care twopence about real political questions
    in the back-streets. They mostly say, "My father was a Blue and
    his father afore 'im, and I've bin a Blue all my life, and I
    ain't a goin' to change my colour now. You're all right, Sir;
    you've no call to bother about me. I wish you success." They
    don't mind being asked any amount of questions as to where they
    lived before, how long they've been in their present houses,
    and so on. It's all a kind of entertainment to them. Here and
    there, of course, you come on a keen politician, who really
    understands. I hear CHORKLE's dinner to-morrow is to be a grand
    affair.</p>

    <h2>ADVANCE, AUSTRALIA!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>From our Special Correspondent at the Agricultural
    Hall.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Need I say that I felt greatly gratified at finding myself
    attached to the Victorian Volunteers. I had been present with
    them in spirit at the banquets which had greeted their arrival
    to the Mother Country, and now I was to have the advantage of
    actually appearing bodily in their campaign at Islington. I
    knew the battle-field well. In years gone by I had seen many a
    Balaclava <i>mêlée</i>, many a slicing of the lemon, many a
    securing of the tent-peg. Nay, further, I had assisted many a
    time at "the combined display," when, before a huge audience, a
    presentment of war was produced, as unlike the real thing as
    anything well could be. But, to return to the Victorians. As
    they appeared in their neat uniforms, which included slouch
    hats, the hearts of a noble people (represented by occupants of
    places from ten shillings downwards) went out to them, and they
    were greeted with a mighty shout. The English race recognised
    the service that was being done. The Mother thanked her Child.
    Over the stormy sea had come the soldiers of the Southern Cross
    to tell any Britons still remaining in played-out Europe how
    war should be waged; how battles should be won.</p>

    <p>The numbers of our gallant little body were small; still, we
    had enough. Before our appearance "the country" had been
    arranged. In the distance, near the southern entrance, were
    bushes; then, a little nearer home, a second row; then, nearer
    still, a canvas erection representing a fallen tree; then more
    bushes; and last, the door from which we had emerged to receive
    the plaudits of the populace. First, two of our number (after
    some slight hesitation) galloped (taking, without much
    difficulty, the hedges on their way) towards the south. They
    fired. In the meanwhile the rest of our body had dismounted,
    and had buckled the forelegs of each horse so that it might not
    unduly wander. This clever idea was nearly crowned with
    success. Then tents were got out&mdash;without any hurry. They
    were pitched in a leisurely fashion. Then the fire was lighted,
    also without flurry. The two scouts now cantered back knocking
    over a bush on their way. Shots were heard in the distance, and
    our camp was leisurely, very leisurely, broken up. The tents
    were, with some difficulty, placed on the backs of the horses,
    and most of our troopers mounted without serious difficulty.
    One certainly was thrown, and another had to hold firmly to his
    horse. Then we advanced. We again dismounted. One of our body,
    after some negotiation, collected the reins of our horses. We
    fired, and again leisurely mounted. Then our troopers hurried
    off.</p>

    <p>And when the magnificent display was over, I could not help
    thinking how good it was of these gallant Colonists to come so
    far that we might learn so much. True, we had seen something a
    little like the mounted infantry evolutions in the displays of
    our own light Hussars. Again, soldiers have been known before
    this to pitch and strike a tent. Still, it was deeply
    gratifying to find history repeating itself, inasmuch, as in
    the Victorian evolutions there was no difficulty in conjuring
    up the picture with the popular title, "The Grandson teaching
    the Grandmother&mdash;how to suck eggs!"</p>

    <p>They were only a few poor Polish Jews, there might have been
    a hundred of them all told, beaten, scourged, driven by a
    brutal and merciless Government to "move on,"
    somewhere&mdash;anywhere,&mdash;it cared not, so long as they
    had no abiding home, no hope of peace, of comfort, or of even
    the common necessaries of existence, and stricken with despair
    and overcome with terror, they meet with their good angel.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Middleman, the blessed agent, to them, of all good,
    tells them of the bright free land, where a golden harvest of
    profit is waiting them, if they will only realise their "all"
    and hand it over to him. With a shout of joy, in grateful pæans
    they sing the praises of their preserver,&mdash;and realising
    all their worldly wealth and making it over to him, they
    arrive, greedy, hunger-smitten and expectant, one damp May
    morning in Whitechapel.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>They find a native population, struggling in terrible
    earnest with want, and taking, through the Sweater who commands
    the situation, starvation prices for the making of a coat, for
    the which, by working nineteen hours in the day, and reducing
    life to the slavery of a living death, they manage to earn two
    shillings and ninepence!</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The happy and eager Polish Jews step in, and see their
    chance. Eldorado lies before them. They are asked if they will
    make the coat for two shillings and sevenpence. The poor
    starving foreigners eagerly clutch at any chance. Who can blame
    <i>them</i>? No one. It is a struggle for life. Fair but false
    promises have brought them to these shores, to swell the sum of
    misery, already, Heaven knows, high enough! But still they
    come, keeping up a steady flow of suffering, and the Government
    makes no sign or move, though people who think are loudly
    clamouring, and asking, "How long shall such things be?"</p>

    Syndicate has now arranged to build a Coliseum of its own,
    double the size of yours, and to reproduce Forum, Parthenon,
    Capitol, Vatican, as well as Windsor Castle and Westminster

    <p>Yes, that's all very fine, IZAAK. But it depends upon your
    pitch&mdash;and your companions. I say, G-SCH-N, what
    <i>are</i> you up to? Don't let the punt swing round like that,
    man, I was nearly over, and my tackle's fouled.</p>

    <p><i>G-sch-n</i> (<i>struggling with pole</i>). All very well
    for you to sit coolly there and criticise me, ARTHUR!
    <i>Wh-o-o-of!</i> Confound the punt, it's all over the place,
    and the stream's like a mill-race.</p>

    <p><i>B-lf-r</i>. Well, hold on to the pole, JOKIM, or we shall
    be all adrift. We'd better have kept to our first pitch; it
    <i>was</i> quiet there, and we hooked one or two sizeable ones.
    (<i>Aside.</i>) Fact is, you're such a fidget, you lose your
    fish, and then want to change the pitch.</p>

    <p><i>G-sch-n</i> (<i>aside</i>). That's right, grumble,
    grumble! Dawdling duffer, he sprawls across the well in one of
    his infernal æsthetic attitudes, picks the best swim, and girds
    at us who have to handle the poles. Wonder SM-TH stands it.</p>

    <p><i>Sm-th</i> (<i>aside</i>). Well, it's a good job I'm back
    in the punt. G-SCH-N may be all very well at a right-away race
    in a wager-boat, when the money's on, and I've seen him do a
    decent bit of bank-fishing in a pegged-down match; but he
    <i>doesn't</i> shine as a punter, though he fancies himself a
    second ABEL BEASLEY. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Hitch on that chain,

    <p><i>G-sch-n.</i> Well, wind up, then!</p>

    <h2>CHILD'S CHIT-CHAT.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Possibly written for proposed insertion in certain of
    Mr. Punch's Feminine Contemporaries.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Dearest LENA,&mdash;We are now back from Herne Bay, where,
    staying at Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;'s<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       Boarding House, we met some of the smartest people. If ever
       you visit this delightful watering-place, mind you look Mrs.
       &mdash;&mdash; up. She is a most charming creature, and the
       <i>poulet rôti au sauce pain</i> at the <i>table d'hôte</i>,
       is simply charming. Her terms, considering the company you
       meet, are very reasonable. Now, I know you want to learn all
       about my new gowns. Well, the Pater insisted that I should
       send to the &mdash;&mdash; Clothing Company, of
       &mdash;&mdash;, for patterns. He says (dear old boy!) that
       we should "patronise British Industry." I got, amongst other
       delightful notions, the cleverest idea possible in stripes,
       and intending to be very economical, bought a paper pattern
       from &mdash;&mdash; in &mdash;&mdash; Street. Well, I turned
       out, all by myself, a most stylish frock, which ISABELLE
       says suits me to the ground. But the task exhausted both my
       intelligence and industry. The rest of the materials I took
       to Madame &mdash;&mdash; of &mdash;&mdash; Street, and she
       is simply making them lovely! I think I told you that Madame
       &mdash;&mdash; is supplying most of the dresses that will be
       worn at JESSIE JONES' (you know, the daughter of Lady JONES)
       wedding. Lady SMITH will look simply superb in rhubarb-tart
       satin, and the Countess of COLHOLEBOROUGH has a wonderful
       gown made of squash-beetled coloured velvet slashed with
       green, that is sure to be the talk of the Row until the end
       of the Season!</p>

    <p>Of course, we have been to all the Private Views. We miss
    the Grosvenor very much, for the New is scarcely a substitute.
    However, I saw several smart people at the latter
    place&mdash;some of them ladies of title, my dear. At the door
    I found standing one of &mdash;&mdash;'s, of &mdash;&mdash;
    Street, victorias. They are very nice, and, as they can be
    bought on the three years' hire system, most convenient. The
    pictures at the Academy struck me as rather dull this year. Of
    course, everybody is much struck with Mr. FILDES'
    "<i>Doctor</i>." By the way, if the poor little patient is
    suffering from influenza (as I fancy he is), he would have
    obtained immediate relief by taking &mdash;&mdash;'s
    &mdash;&mdash;. But leaving medical subjects out of the
    question, there are other gloomy pictures&mdash;besides
    patients, heaps of prisoners, and lots of paupers. Fortunately,
    most of these last are "skied," which is a blessing! I hear
    that the Academicians have bought Mr. CALDERON's picture out of
    the Chantrey Bequest. So selfish to deprive the public of the
    chance! However, as the subject is a little <i>risqué</i>,
    perhaps it is just as well that it <i>should</i> be buried in
    the Diploma Gallery.</p>

    <p>The usual gaiety last week. Mrs. PARAGRAPH PRESSCUTTERBY
    gave a magnificent Ball at &mdash;&mdash; Square. The whole of
    the garden was covered in by Messrs. &mdash;&mdash;, of
    &mdash;&mdash; Street, and the massed Bands of the Cavalry
    Brigade at &mdash;&mdash; supplied the Music. The supper
    (furnished by Messrs. &mdash;&mdash;, of &mdash;&mdash;
    Street), was served in the Lawn Cricket Saloon, and the
    gigantic apartment was crammed the whole evening. I know you
    like recipes. I extract the following from &mdash;&mdash;'s
    <i>Guide to Grub</i>, a capital <i>brochure</i> published at a
    shilling.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Pick, wash (in plenty of water), and drain 2 lbs. of
        crab-shells without bruising them. Pare and core some well
        shaped apples. When these are well heated, add the spinach.
        Cut into neat slices a dish of lamb's fry, and fry it a
        nice brown in the bacon liquor. Boil all together till the
        syrup is reduced to half the quantity, then lay the lemon
        peel on the apples, and pour the syrup over them."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is a Russian dish, and is called Böösh. You must tell me
    what you think of it. Ever your most loving friend, SYLLIE.</p>

    <h2>ROBERT AT THE DARBY.</h2>

    <p>By sum strange cohincidence as I ain't the least abel to
    account for, the annual buthday of my much better half fell
    this year on the grate Darby Day! and so we both agreed as weed
    have one more jolly happy day together, ewen if so be as we
    never had another. So off I sets, and I takes two box seats
    houtside a homnibus and four spanking Bays, I think they calls
    'em, coz they was such a butiful dark brown colour, and for
    which I paid no less than 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a peace, and
    with our pockets pretty well stuffed full of sanwiches, and
    jest a nice little flarsk of summut nice, never mind what, off
    we sets for the City at nine a clock, hay hem, and at nine
    forty by the church clock off we starts on our perrylus
    journey, reddy, as the Poet says, to dash through thick and
    thin.</p>

    <p>As it appened it was fortunet as we was so prepared, for,
    strange to say, we hadn't got so werry far from Lundon Bridge,
    when, by sum mistake of the Clark of the whether, as our jolly
    Coachman told us, it began for to rain, but he said as how as
    he knowd as much about the Darby wether as most men, as he'd
    driven there about twenty times in the larst duzzen years, and
    what we was a having was ony a parsing shower. How it was I
    coudnt quite undustand, for whether we druv fast or whether we
    druv slow, doose a bit coud we get away from that parsing
    shower. However, tho' we did both get jolly wet, we had sum
    capital fun, for we seed no less than too coaches and four
    upset in the road, and to see the poor passengers all a
    standing in the mud, which it was about amost up to their nees,
    and a wundering what time they shood get to the Darby, was more
    than enuff to console us, and we all larfed artily and left
    'em. Such is human Natur!</p>

    <p>Before we both got quite wet through, I got my best beloved
    a seat inside, and, strange to say, although she was werry much
    scrowged, she axshally prefurrd it to setting out in the rain
    along of me. It may have bin thorts of her new Bonnet. Such
    agane is human Natur! Luckily, jest after she left me, one of
    our wheels sunk down in a werry deep ole, and all on us on my
    side had to get down into the fearful mud, and wait till our
    gallant steeds pulled it out again, and, unluckily, the one as
    pulled hardest, let his foot slip, and sent a reglar shower of
    whity-brown mud all over me from top to toe, or rayther, from
    At to Boots, and I was in that orful state that all our set,
    Coachman and all, acshally roared with larfter. Such again, I
    fears, is human Nature!</p>

    <p>When we got to the Darby, in course our fust thort was
    lunch, but afore I coud get beyond laying the cloth, there came
    such a reglar buster of an ail storm that we was all drove
    hunder the homnibus for shelter, and when it leaved off, and I
    went on the roof, the table cloth was about three inches thick
    with round ale stones! Ah, that was a difficult lunch that was,
    and beat all my xperience in that line.</p>

    <p>I didn't see much of the race, I didn't, for as it pored in
    torrents all the time, I had to seek for a shelter, and under a
    omnibus is not a werry favrabel place to get a good view of a
    horse-race, but ewery body seemed to speak of it as a werry
    common one, whatever that may mean. However we was hamply
    reckompensed by the most wunderful site as praps was hever seen
    in the shape of humberellers. Heverybody had one, and
    heverybody put it hup, so, as my better harf poetically
    expressed it, it was xacly like a most butiful field of
    henormous mushrooms a hopening out theirselves to the morning
    hair!</p>

    <p>We was remarkably fortnate in cumming back, as it didn't
    rain near so much as it did in the morning, and quite left off
    jest as we got home. My sweet darling didn't grumbel a bit at
    me for giving her such a reglar damper for her birthday, but
    the werry larst thing as she did say that night was, "Thank
    you, ROBERT dear, for your little holliday, but I think that we
    won't spend my next buthday at the Darby!"</p>

    <h3>OUR PARTICULAR TIP COMES OFF RIGHT!</h3>

    <p>You may remember that last week, just before the Derby, I
    furnished you with a prophecy. So that there might be no doubt
    about it, I named the absolute First, Second, and Third. Said I
    (page 255), "We may take it that the winner will be found out
    of the <i>Common</i>." But this was not enough. That all should
    secure One, Two, and Three, I wrote, "Well might FRANÇOIS
    PREMIER have observed (as I do), 'Bravo, <i>Gouverneur</i>!'"
    implying that the French horse was certain of a place. But I
    went further still; I gave the Third. I carefully introduced in
    my short article the name of every probable starter, save
    <i>Martenhurst</i>, who consequently became "the Field." And
    what did I say of the Field? Why, "This year's Derby will be
    won by one of two. It will either fall to the Favourite or the
    Field." Surely this was good enough to point out No. 3? Cheques
    from grateful backers may be sent to 85, Fleet Street,
    addressed to THE ODD MAN OUT.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, May 25</i>.&mdash;Members
    coming back in slightly increased numbers. HARCOURT returned
    from his wandering to and fro. AKERS-DOUGLAS back after his
    influenza experience; presently coming up to "tell" in a
    division, is welcomed by a cheer that rises as heartily from
    Opposition Benches as from Ministerial ranks. JACKSON also back
    out of the Shadowed Valley; GORST, in his place again,
    sprinkles fine pinches of sublimated cayenne pepper upon
    CRAWFORD and others who want to know about Manipur.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:21%;">
        <a href="images/275-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/275-2.png"
             alt="Mr. W.H. Smith ('Old Morality')." /></a>Back View
             of a Ruthless Tyrant.
    </div>

    <p>But though various benches filled up with familiar figures,
    Members look round in vain for one; finding it not, will not be
    comforted. Where is OLD MORALITY? Last time he was seen was on
    the Thursday preceding the holidays. He had come back newly
    elected for the Strand; took part in business of sitting; just
    before dinner Members had watched his lithe figure disappearing
    towards the doorway, and he had been seen no more. House had
    met again on the following night; had adjourned for the
    truncated holiday; had met again; and still OLD MORALITY's seat
    was vacant, and there dwelt in the fond memory only that
    parting back view.</p>

    <p>JOKIM occupying, but not filling, OLD MORALITY's seat,
    wanted to talk about various things; but ever the conversation
    came back to the theme that filled all thoughts. HARCOURT
    wanted to know about fixing the day for debate on Manipur;
    HENRY FOWLER hankered after an understanding about the Factory
    and Workshops Bill. Everybody but JEMMY LOWTHER wanted to know
    about the Education Bill; TIM HEALY was curious to learn what
    course would be taken with respect to DE COBAIN. The answer was
    ever the same. "The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"
       id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span> House," said JOKIM,
       nervously rubbing his hands, "must await the return of my
       Right Hon. friend, which we expect will be celebrated on
       Wednesday."</p>

    <p>"Well," said HARCOURT, in one of his stage asides, "this is
    a revelation indeed. Always thought OLD MORALITY was an
    easy-going gentleman, deferential in manner, unassertive in
    action. It seems he's a regular tyrant, a sort of
    unapproachable Padishah. In his bosom are looked all the
    secrets of State, all the purposes of the Ministry. He takes no
    one into his confidence, but broods over the destinies of the
    Empire in the haughty solitude of the watch-tower at Walmer.
    When he goes away for short holiday, public business entirely
    dislocated. No one can say or do anything except hoarsely
    whisper his name. JOKIM lives in a state of terror, and even
    the martial spirit of GEORGE HAMILTON cowers in recollecting
    his presence. Only shows how prone humanity is to error. We and
    the Public generally have created for ourselves an OLD
    MORALITY, a genial, beaming, modest, unobtrusive personality,
    always ready to oblige, desirous of meeting the views of
    Members in all parts of the House, anxious only to do his duty
    to his QUEEN and Country. Whereas it is clear he is a martinet
    of the severest type, a ruthless tyrant, a man who rules with a
    rod of iron, and keeps his followers in a condition of abject
    personal terror."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote on Account taken.
    Incidentally, OLD MORALITY's character brought out in its true
    light.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;AMURATH to AMURATH succeeds. We had a
    Lord ELCHO, and, thank Heaven! we have one still&mdash;not
    exactly the same, but curiously reminiscent in voice and
    gesture. This succession of son to sire is one of the happiest
    arrangements of the British Constitution, one most promising
    for its maintenance and prosperity. If the House of Lords,
    peremptorily and selfishly, appropriated our ELCHOS and our
    GATHORNE HARDYS, turning them into Earl of WEMYSS, and Viscount
    CRANBROOK, leaving us no substitute or compensation, that
    long-threatened institution would be finally doomed. But, by
    beneficent arrangement, when ELCHO and GATHORNE HARDY fared
    forth, the one to become Earl of WEMYSS, and the other Lord
    CRANBROOK, behold! there step into their places other, and
    younger men, bearing the old name.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/276-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/276-1.png"
             alt="After the Adjournment." /></a>After the
             Adjournment.
    </div>

    <p>Thus is the wind tempered to the shorn lamb. The system
    works beneficently in two ways. Like the quality of mercy, it
    is not strained. It blesseth him that gives, and him that
    takes. The House of Lords is strengthened by the new recruits,
    and we still have our ELCHO to make jokes, and our HARDY to
    preach sermons.</p>

    <p>Listening to ELCHO, jauntily moving adjournment over Derby
    Day, I say all this to the SAGE of QUEEN ANNE'S GATE, who
    shortly replies, "Fudge!" Remark does not seem consequential;
    not at all sure that it is Parliamentary.</p>

    <p>Long debate on Budget Bill; HARCOURT discourses at large on
    JOKIM's finance. JOKIM sits listening with amused air. Life is
    on the whole to him a serious thing. But there is one episode
    that suffuses it with a gleam of humour; that is to hear
    HARCOURT talking Finance. "One of the very few things," JOKIM
    says, "of which he knows absolutely nothing." Now J.A. PICTON,
    on the contrary, thinks a good deal of HARCOURT's aptitude for
    finance, and when JOKIM had girded at him for the space of half
    an hour, the SQUIRE OF MILWOOD had the satisfaction of hearing
    JULIUS 'ANNIBAL PICTON publicly describe his criticism as "a
    most formidable attack on the financial scheme of the
    Chancellor of the Exchequer."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;House agrees to make holiday on
    the Derby Day.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;OLD MORALITY back to-night; everyone
    glad to see him; with trumpets also and shawms would we have
    greeted him, but SPEAKER ruled proposed demonstration out of
    order; so only cheered. With exception of slight Italian accent
    (particularly noticeable in his pronunciation of the word
    "Newfoundland") he's just the same. Before sitting far
    advanced, wished he had lingered for another twenty-four hours
    on the waters of the tideless sea.</p>

    <p>Newfoundland Fishery Question on; the delegates to be heard
    at Bar. Members, eager as school-boys for new sensation,
    crowded the Benches, in expectation of half an hour's
    amusement. OLD MORALITY, fresh from Cabinet Council, knew that
    hope would be disappointed. Government had decided to accept
    compromise proffered by Newfoundland Legislature; consequently
    Sir WILLIAM VALLANCE WHITEWAY, K.C.M.G., would not appear at
    the Bar.</p>

    <p>It is Old MORALITY's little way to put on appearance, in
    whatever startling development of affairs, as if what was
    happening was exactly what had been expected. To-night, at end
    of questions, he quite casually mentions settlement arrived at,
    and proposes that without debate Second Reading of Newfoundland
    Fisheries Bill shall be taken. "A mere form, you know," he
    said, nodding in friendly fashion across the table at HARCOURT.
    "Everything is amicably settled; we certainly won't mention
    Bill again for three weeks, and then only to withdraw it. Let
    us read it now a second time just for the fun of the
    thing."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:15%;">
        <a href="images/276-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/276-2.png"
             alt="Mr. Akers-Douglas." /></a>Gone Over to the
             Majority.
    </div>

    <p>Crowded House sat for a moment in gloomy disappointment,
    irresponsive to the cheerful presence of Old MORALITY, who
    succeeded in looking as if he had said something which, though
    of no serious importance, was calculated to be generally
    acceptable. Actual position was something akin to what used to
    happen in St. James's Hall when Manager came forward to
    announce that, owing to sudden cold, Mr. SIMS REEVES would not
    be able to sing. Members glared round as if they were going to
    ask for their money back; increasingly aggravating to have OLD
    MORALITY still nodding and smiling on Treasury Bench. If he
    thought they were going to be put off in that way, should learn
    he was mistaken; so Debate raged over three hours, at end of
    which, OLD MORALITY, swearing he would ne'er consent to
    adjournment of Debate, consented.</p>

    <p>Just now, AKERS-DOUGLAS moved Writ for New Election in the
    City, and for the moment Members turned from Newfoundland to
    think kindly of genial, hearty, honest "YAH! YAH!" gone over to
    the majority.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Newfoundland Fisheries Bill
    shelved.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;JOKIM had another tumble. Came down
    with light heart at Morning Sitting, proposing to run Budget
    Bill through Committee. HENRY FOWLER, certainly not an
    obstructive party, objected, on constitutional ground, that
    CHANCELLOR OF EXCHEQUER was asking House to propose taxation
    for purposes not yet defined, "Give us your Education Bill
    first," said FOWLER, "and then we'll vote the Budget that
    provides ways and means. No Education Bill, no Budget."</p>

    <p>Argument irresistible. JOKIM meekly withdrew, and House took
    up other business.</p>

    <p>This continuous blundering not cheerful for Ministers;
    wonderful how AKERS-DOUGLAS bears up; more than usually beaming
    to-night. Don't understand till <i>Gazette</i> comes out, when,
    looking down Birthday List, find they've made him a Privy
    Councillor.</p>

    <p>"My Right Hon. friend, if I may call him so," says the
    MEMBER for SARK, "richly deserves the honour. I've known a good
    many Whips in my time, but I never came across one who did
    equally effective work with less friction, than does the Right
    Hon. ARETAS AKERS-DOUGLAS."</p>

    <p>A.A. DOUGLAS is of course a mistake; his real initials are
    A1 DOUGLAS.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee of Supply.</p>

    <h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

    <p>MY DEAR BARON,&mdash;Let me recommend to your favourable
    notice, and to that of your readers, "<i>Stories told at
    Twilight</i>," by Mrs. CHANDLER MOULTON, the American poetess,
    who has demonstrated how deftly she can touch the lyre, and
    shows what a clever storyteller she can be. These are not
    ghost-stories as one might imagine, but tales for children,
    told with so much grace and feeling that they will also secure
    a large audience among children of a larger growth.</p>

    <p>Also look at <i>Old Time Punishments</i>, by Mr. WILLIAM
    ANDREWS, who gives an exhaustive account of ancient
    punishments, copiously illustrated, and so graphically
    described, that he makes us congratulate ourselves in not
    having flourished in the olden times, or we might have become
    practical illustrations of the discipline of our forefathers.
    How are you getting along with GEORGE MEREDITH's <i>One of Our
    Conquerors</i>?</p>

    <p>Yours,</p>

    <p class="author">HEAD CLERK IN THE BOOKING-OFFICE.</p>

    <p><i>Reply from Baron de B.-W.</i>&mdash;Mislaid "The GEO.

    had reached the middle of it, and the story was beginning. Most
    unfortunate. Must advertise for it.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
